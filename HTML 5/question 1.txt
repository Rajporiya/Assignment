Difference b/w HTML & HTML5?

    --> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and HTML5 are both markup languages used for creating and structuring content on the web. 
    --> However, there are several key differences between them:

        1. Doctype Declaration:

            --> HTML: The doctype declaration for HTML is more complex, e.g., <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 
                Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">.
            
            --> HTML5: The doctype is simplified to <!DOCTYPE html>.

        2. New Elements:

            --> HTML: Contains a limited set of elements.

            --> HTML5: Introduces new semantic elements such as <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <nav>, and <aside>, which help 
                in structuring the content more meaningfully.

        3. Multimedia Support:

            --> HTML: Requires third-party plugins (like Flash) for audio and video.

            --> HTML5: Provides native support for audio and video with the <audio> and <video> elements, allowing for easier embedding 
                and playback.

        4. Form Enhancements:

            --> HTML: Basic form elements and attributes.

            --> HTML5: Introduces new input types (e.g., email, date, range, color) and attributes (e.g., placeholder, autofocus, required), 
                enhancing form functionality and user experience.

        5. APIs and Features:

            --> HTML: Limited in terms of APIs.

            --> HTML5: Includes various APIs such as the Canvas API for drawing graphics, the Geolocation API for location-based services, 
                and the Web Storage API for storing data locally.

        6. Error Handling:

            --> HTML: More strict about syntax and structure, leading to more errors in rendering.

            --> HTML5: More forgiving of errors, allowing for better compatibility across different browsers.
        
        7. Compatibility:

            --> HTML: Older versions may not be fully compatible with modern browsers.

            --> HTML5: Designed to be backward compatible with older HTML versions while also being forward-compatible with future developments.


    In summary, HTML5 is a more advanced and flexible version of HTML, designed to support modern web applications and improve the overall 
    user experience on the web.
