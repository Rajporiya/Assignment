What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in HTML? Provide examples of each.
    --> In HTML, elements are categorized into two main types: block-level elements and inline elements. 
    --> The key differences between them are as follows:

Block-Level Elements :- 
    1. Display Behavior:
        --> Block-level elements take up the full width available, meaning they start on a new line and extend the entire width of their
             parent container.
    2. Structure: 
        --> They are typically used to create the main structure of a web page. Common block-level elements include:
            <div>,
            <p>,
            <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc. (headings)
            <ul>, <ol>, <li> (lists)
            <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>

    3. Containment:
        --> Block-level elements can contain other block-level elements as well as inline elements.

    4. Examples:-
        --> <div>: A generic container for grouping content.
        --> <p>: Represents a paragraph of text.
        --> <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.: Headings of different levels.
        --> <ul>: An unordered list.
        --> <ol>: An ordered list.
        --> <li>: A list item within a list.
        --> <header>: Represents introductory content or a group of navigational links.
        --> <footer>: Represents footer content for a section or page.
       
Inline Elements
    
    1. Display Behavior:-
        --> Inline elements do not start on a new line; they only take up as much width as necessary. They flow within the content
            of block-level elements.
    
    2. Purpose:-
        --> Inline elements are typically used for smaller pieces of content within a block. Common inline elements include:
            <span>
            <a> (anchor/link)
            <strong> (bold text)
            <em> (italic text)
            <img> (image)

    3. Containment:- 
        --> Inline elements can only contain text and other inline elements, but not block-level elements.

    4. Examples :-  
         --> <span>: A generic inline container for text or other inline elements.
        --> <a>: An anchor element used to create hyperlinks.
        --> <strong>: Indicates that the text is of strong importance (usually rendered as bold).
        --> <em>: Indicates emphasized text (usually rendered as italic).
        --> <img>: Embeds an image within the content.
        --> <br>: Inserts a line break.
        --> <code>: Represents a fragment of computer code.
