Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission. When should each be used?

    --> The Get and POST methods are two of the most commonly used HTTP request method for form submission in web application.
    --> Here's breakdown of their differences and when to user each

    Get Method :-
        --> 1. Data Transmission: :- 
                --> The GET method appends data to the URL in the form of query parameters. For example, a form submission might look like this:

            2. Visibility :-
                --> Data sent via GET is visible in the URL, which can be bookmarked or shared. This makes it less secure for sensitive information.
            
            3. Data Length:-
                --> There is a limit to the amount of data that can be sent using GET, typically around 2048 characters, depending on the browser and server.

            4. Use Cases:-
                --> GET is generally used for retrieving data or when the action is idempotent (i.e., it does not change the state of the server). 
                --> Examples include search forms or filtering data.

    POST Method :-

        1. Data Transmission:-
            --> The POST method sends data in the body of the HTTP request, not in the URL. This allows for larger amounts of data to be sent.

        2. Visibility:- 
            --> Data sent via POST is not visible in the URL, making it more secure for transmitting sensitive information, such as passwords or personal details.

        3. Data Length:-
            --> There is no practical limit to the amount of data that can be sent using POST, making it suitable for large data submissions.
        
        4. Use Cases:-
            --> POST is used when submitting data that will change the state of the server, such as creating or updating records. 
            --> Examples include user registration forms, login forms, and file uploads.


    when tousle get method :- 

        1. Retrieving Data:-
            --> Use GET when the form is used to retrieve or query data without causing any side effects on the server. 
            --> For example, search forms or filters.

        2. Idempotent Actions:
            --> GET requests should be idempotent, meaning that making the same request multiple times will not change the state of the server. 
            --> For instance, fetching a list of products.

        3. Bookmarking and Sharing:-
            --> If the results of the form submission should be easily shareable or bookmarkable, use GET. 
            --> The parameters will be included in the URL, making it easy to save or share.

        4. Small Amounts of Data:-
            --> Use GET when the amount of data being sent is small and does not exceed URL length limits (typically around 2048 characters).

    When to use POST :-

        1. Submitting Data:-
            --> Use POST when the form is used to submit data that will change the state of the server, such as creating, updating, or deleting records. 
            --> Examples include user registration, login forms, and data uploads.

        2. Sensitive Information:-
            --> If the data being submitted includes sensitive information (e.g., passwords, personal details), use POST to keep this data out of the URL 
                and reduce exposure.

        3. Large Amounts of Data:-
            --> Use POST when you need to send large amounts of data, such as file uploads or extensive form submissions, as there are no practical limits on
                 the size of the data sent in the body of the request.

        4. Non-Idempotent Actions:-
            --> Use POST for actions that are not idempotent, meaning that submitting the same request multiple times may result in different outcomes 
                (e.g., creating multiple records).
