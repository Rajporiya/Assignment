        </table>
     --> An HTML table is structured using th <table>tag.
     --> which contains rows<tr>, table data cells<td>, and optionally header cells<th>.
     --> Rows are defined by <tr> tags and within each now.



    Purpose of following elements :-

    1. <table>
        --> The container element that defines an HTML table.
        --> Table tags calls the table content (rows, cells, header etc.)
        --> without tables tags the browser will not recognize the content as a table.
    
    2. <tr>
        --> <tr> means table row.
        --> each <tr> represents a horizontal row of cells.

    3. <th>
        --> <th> means table header
        --> Typically appears in the first row / first column.
        --> text inside <th> is bold and centered by default.

    4. <td>
        --> <td> means table data
        --> <td> text is left aligned and normal weight by default.

    5. <thead>
        --> <thead> means Table header
        --> contains one or more <tr> element with <th> cells.
        ==> Help browsers and screen readers identiy column header.
        --> Optional but recommended for better and accessibility.
